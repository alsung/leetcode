# Leetcode Question 92

# Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers left and right where left <= right,
# reverse the nodes of the list from position left to position right, and return the reversed
# list. 

# Example 1
# input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], left = 2, right = 4
# output: [1,4,3,2,5]

# input: head = [5], left = 1, right = 1
# output: [5]
